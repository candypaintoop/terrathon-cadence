We’re building EcoSphere AI, a GenAI-powered simulation tool that designs and optimizes vertical algae-based photobioreactor walls for urban buildings. 
It analyzes city pollution data, weather patterns, and water availability to create the most efficient wall designs, maximizing CO₂ absorption, greywater recycling, and biomass production — all without physical prototypes. 
The AI continuously learns, improving performance with every iteration (hopefully)
